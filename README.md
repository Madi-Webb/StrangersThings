Stranger's Things is a 'Craigslist' type fake e-commerce site. This project focuses mainly on front-end skills with React v18. The site fetches from *[Stranger's Things API](https://strangers-things.herokuapp.com/api/)* to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy data with user authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ~ and all in a fun Stranger Things theme bc why not.
